# Pacman
**Game project**

The game is written in C++ language. It emphasizes object-oriented programming.
FirstSFML is the name of the project. For all graphical interfaces, the SFML is used.
The project is made in Xcode and tutorial on how to install SFML can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOyp5n2FmZY).

The game currently does not have ghosts, and it's still in the process of making. Right now, you can move your player through a map and collect points.
